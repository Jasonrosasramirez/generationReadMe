# 09 Node.js Homework: Professional README Generator

## The Task

When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the app. 
Quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.


## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions

WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README 

WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests 

WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under -- (check) -- 

WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile

WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions 

WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README

```
